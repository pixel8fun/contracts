# Pixel8 contracts

Smart contracts for [Pixel8](https://pixel8.art).

Features:

  * **Fully on-chain metadata (including images)!**
* `MintSwapPool` pool inspired by [SudoSwap](https://github.com/sudoswap/lssvm).
  * Exponential price curve.
  * Pool mints NFTs on-demand until no more left to mint. Initial buyers thus recieve minted freshly NFTs.
  * Sellers sell NFTs into pool, and subsequent buyers recieve these NFTs until they run out, after which the pool again mints new NFTs.
* To encourage holders to mint and reveal NFTs a points system is implemented:
  * A percentage of every NFT trade goes into a prize pool, accumulating over time.
  * Every permissioned mint will award points to the caller.
  * Every permissioned reveal will award points to the caller.
  * After all tiles have been minted and revealed the users with the highest points can claim a share of the prize pool.

Technicals details:

* Built with Foundry.
* ERC721 (based on [Solmate](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC721.sol)) + Enumerability + Custom token URI.
* Batch transfers and mints.
* ERC2981 royalty standard.
* ERC4906 metadata updates.
* ECDSA signature verification to allow for anyone to mint/reveal with authorisation.
* Extensive [test suite](./test/) and [excellent code coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/pixel8fun/contracts).

## On-chain addresses

_TODO_

## Development

Install pre-requisites:

* [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)
* [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

Then run:

```shell
$ bun i
$ bun prepare
```

To compile the contracts:

```shell
$ bun compile
```

To test:

```shell
$ bun tests
```

With coverage:

```shell
$ bun tests-coverage
```

To view the coverage report from the generated `lcov.info` file you will need to have [genhtml](https://command-not-found.com/genhtml) installed. Once this is done you can run:

```shell
$ bun view-coverage
```


## Deployment

_Notes:_

* _The `owner`, `minter`, `revealer` and `pool` roles are all set to be the deployment wallet's address._
* _[CREATE2](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/create2-tutorial) is used for deployment, so the address will always be the same as long as the deployment wallet and bytecode are the same, irrespective of chain, nonce, etc._

### Local (anvil)

To deploy locally, first run a local devnet:

```shell
$ bun devnet
```

Then run:

```shell
$ bun deploy-local
```

### Public testnet: Base sepolia

Set the following environment variables:

```shell
$ export PRIVATE_KEY="0x..." # testnet deployer wallet (see 1password)
$ export VERIFIER_API_KEY="..." # basescan.org api key (see 1password)
```

Then run:

```shell
$ bun deploy-testnet
```

Save the new deployed addresses and constructor args into `scripts/verify-contracts.ts` and then run:

```shell
$ bun verify-testnet
```
